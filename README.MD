## 🧠 Team Retrospective Analysis 

During the collaborative development of our team portfolio, the most significant technical challenge was maintaining **synchronization across multiple branches** while ensuring that everyone’s work could be merged smoothly into the main repository. Because each member developed their section independently, branch histories diverged quickly. This caused issues such as *“refusing to merge unrelated histories”* and overlapping updates on shared files like the main navigation and index structure. We addressed this by adopting a consistent branching strategy and ensuring frequent communication about updates.

A notable **merge conflict** occurred when integrating my branch (`develop`) into the shared `main` branch. The conflict appeared in the `index.html` file, where my teammates had modified the linking structure at the same time I added my personal section. To resolve it, we first used `git fetch` to ensure all remote updates were locally available, then executed `git merge develop`. Git highlighted the conflicting areas, which we manually compared. After reviewing the changes as a team, we preserved the updated navigation from the main branch and inserted my section into the appropriate area. Finally, we tested the unified version locally before committing the resolved file with a clear message.

The **pull request and peer review process** was highly beneficial for ensuring code quality and coherence. Each contribution underwent review by at least one teammate before being merged. This encouraged detailed feedback, helped detect styling inconsistencies, and prevented duplication. It also allowed us to maintain a consistent design system and naming conventions. The process fostered accountability, improved collaboration, and taught us to document our work effectively. Overall, the structured workflow and collective problem-solving approach significantly enhanced both the technical and professional outcomes of our project.
